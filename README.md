<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
  The XHealth project is a website developed for the XHealth Gym, a space dedicated to health, well-being, and physical activities. The gym offers a variety of modalities, including weightlifting, martial arts, dance, HIIT, indoor cycling, functional training, jump, and more.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to create an attractive and informative page for potential clients to get a better understanding of our facilities and high-quality services. The modern and elegant design reflects the excellence of our gym, featuring state-of-the-art equipment and highly qualified instructors who are well-recognized in the market.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

  <strong>Git:</strong> We use Git as a version control system to manage the project's source code. This allows us to work collaboratively as a team, track changes, and ensure code stability.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>HTML:</strong> The HTML markup language forms the foundation of our website. It enables us to structure and organize content, providing a solid base for presenting information to users.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>CSS:</strong> We utilize CSS to style the website, applying the colors, fonts, and layout that reflect the XHealth Gym's visual identity. CSS also ensures a pleasant and responsive user experience across different devices.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamism to the website. With it, we implement features like sending messages for inquiries, displaying detailed training information for students, and other functionalities that enhance the user experience.
